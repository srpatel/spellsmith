- Ensure that animations can be queued.
  Would be good to properly have multiple wizard animations occur such that the staff/projectile always lines up.
- Separate damage dealing from projectile a little more (better done when more art comes back)
- Think about game modes more.
- Tap on wizards health to see current health (or, alternate between percentage and value?)
- Tap on buffs to see what they do (...maybe can get rid of buffs?)
- Better way to correlate buff visuals with buffs.
- Focus -> make you levitate (black shadow on floor, you rise and fall when you gain/lose the buff)

Plan:
- Finish coding infinite mode first
    * saving/loading
    * sync highscores to GC/Google
    * challenging
    * varied
    * fun
- Main menu
    * New game/continue game (same button)
    * icons for xikka/sammy/george (or credits popup)
    * achievements
    * options
    * highscores
- Memory
    * check there are no leaks and that memory footprint is low
- Achievements
    * big grid of achievements
    * toast when you unlock an achievement
    * sync to GC/Google.

Game modes:

Infinite 
	- keep going until you die, and your level is your highscore.
	- if the spell-list runs out, then you get cursed instead (-1 hp, -2 hp, -3 hp etc.)
	- 30ish levels per zone?

Map mode
	- before starting a level it tells you what you will learn if you do the level
	- vertically scrolling map with 31 locations
	- each location has up to three rounds of enemies with up to three enemies each
	- after completing a level you learn a spell
	- you can equip your spells whenever you want
	- that means there are 30 spells in the game.
	- the 31st location is just a boss monster and is v. hard.
