The tutorial takes the form of help boxes and other help appearing over the top of the screen during the first couple of levels.


Level 1:
	Single goblin enemy.

	Pop-up appears saying: 
		"Oh dear! A nasty goblin!"
		"Shoot magic at him by drawing paths of same-coloured crystals."
	When you dismis it, a path is highlighted on the grid.
		You have to draw that path.
		"That's great! Now draw a couple more chains."
	After you've drawn a couple more (ensure goblin doesn't die):
		Highlight the goblin's turn counter
		"This red circle means the goblin is ready to attack."
		"When he attacks he'll deal some damage to you."
	When dismissed, he attacks. Then:
		"Finish him off before he kills you!"
		"Each chain deals 1 damage for each gem."
	When the battle is over:
		The normal level up dialog appears.

		The "Spellbook" button is highlighted.
		"Head to the spellbook to equip this spell!"

Spellbook:
	"Drag Firewisp from your spellbook to one of the spell slots to learn it."
	"Now you'll be able to use it in battle!"

Level 2:
	* If you have no spell equipped, don't allow. Make sure that the spellbook button is highlighted.
	* If you have a spell equipped, but it's not firewisp, then disable the tutorial, and randomise the grid.
		... or just equip firewisp only for this level?
	
	Popup:
		Highlight the spell on the column whilst the popup is showing.
		"You've now got a spell! You can cast it by drawing it on the grid."
		"Any orientation is acceptable!" // Show examples of firewisp underneath.
	On hide:
		Highlight firewisp a couple of times on the grid.
	Popup:
		"Good job! Now it's up to you..."

And that's it : )
